🔐 Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that lets users:

* Check the strength of a given password using realistic scoring
* Generate a custom wordlist using personal information
* Apply variations like leetspeak and common year patterns
* Export the wordlist to a .txt file
* Interact with a simple GUI (built with Tkinter)


 📌 Features

* ✔️ Password strength scoring using zxcvbn
* ✔️ User-friendly GUI with tkinter
* ✔️ Input fields for name, date of birth, and pet name
* ✔️ Wordlist variations: leetspeak, years, upper/lowercase
* ✔️ Save wordlist to a .txt file
* ✔️ Lightweight and beginner-friendly


 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Python 3.x
* zxcvbn (for password analysis)
* tkinter (built-in GUI library)
* Thonny / VS Code / PyCharm (recommended IDEs)

 🚀 How to Run

1. Install Python 3.x (if not already installed)

2. Install the zxcvbn module:

   ```bash
   pip install zxcvbn
   ```

3. Run the script in your preferred IDE (Thonny recommended):

   ```bash
   python password_tool.py
   ```

4. The GUI window will open.

5. Enter a password → Click "Check Strength"

6. Fill in personal details → Click "Generate & Save Wordlist"

7. Choose a location to save the generated wordlist (e.g., wordlist.txt)
